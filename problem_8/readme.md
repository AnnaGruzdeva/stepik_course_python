Write a simple calculator that reads three lines from user input: the first number, the second number and the operation, then applies the operation to the numbers entered ("first number", "operation" "second number") and displays the result on the screen.

Supported operations: +, -, /, *, mod, pow, div, where
mod is taking the remainder of the division,
pow - exponentiation,
div is an integer division.

If division is performed and the second number is 0, it is necessary to output the string "Division by 0!".

Pay attention that real numbers come to the program input.
