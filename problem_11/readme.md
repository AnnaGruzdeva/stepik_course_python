At the Institute of Bioinformatics, a robot is moving around the office. Recently, students from a group of programmers wrote a program for him, according to which a robot, when it enters a room, counts the number of programmers in it and says it out loud: "n programmers".

In order for it to sound right, for each n you need to use the correct ending of the word.

Write a program that reads an integer number n (non-negative) from user input, outputs this number to the console along with the correct word “programmer”, so that the robot can communicate normally with people, for example: 1 programmer, 2 programmers, 5 programmers .

There may be a lot of programmers in the room. Check that your program correctly handles all cases, at least up to 1000 people.
