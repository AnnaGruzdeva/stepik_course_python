At the Institute of Bioinformatics, a competition is organized between informatics and biologists. The winners of the competition will get a big and tasty cake. The team of biologists is a man, and the team of computer scientists is a b man.

It is necessary to cut the cake in advance so that you can distribute the pieces of cake to any team that won the competition, and each participant of this team should get the same number of pieces of cake. And since you do not want to cut the cake into too small pieces, you need to find the minimum suitable number.

Write a program that helps to find this number.
The program must read the sizes of the commands (two positive integers a and b, each number is entered on a separate line) and output the smallest number d, which is divided into both these numbers without a remainder.
