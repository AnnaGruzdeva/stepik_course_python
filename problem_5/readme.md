It is required to determine whether a given year is a leap year.

Recall that leap years are those years whose sequence number is either a multiple of 4, but not a multiple of 100, or a multiple of 400 (for example, the 2000th year was a leap year, and the 2100th will be a non-leap year).

The program should work correctly on the numbers 1900≤n≤3000.

Output "Leap year" if the read year is a leap year and "Normal" otherwise (do not forget to check the case of the characters displayed by the program).

#### Sample Input 1:

2100

#### Sample Output 1:

#### Sample Input 2:

2000

#### Sample Output 2:
