When Paul was in school, he memorized the multiplication table with rectangular blocks. For training, he would be very useful program, which would show the block multiplication table.

Write a program, the input of which is given four numbers a, b, c and d, each in its own line. The program should output a fragment of the multiplication table for all numbers of the interval [a; b] to all the numbers of the interval [c; d].

The numbers a, b, c and d are natural and do not exceed 10, a≤b, c≤d.

#### Sample Input 1:

7
