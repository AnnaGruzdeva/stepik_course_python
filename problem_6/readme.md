In that distant time, when Pasha went to school, he didn’t like Heron’s formula for calculating the area of ​​a triangle, as it seemed too complicated. At one point, Pavel decided to save all schoolchildren from suffering and write and distribute a program to schools that calculates the area of ​​the triangle on three sides.

One problem: since Paul did not like this formula, he did not remember it. Help him to complete a good deed and write a program that calculates the area of ​​a triangle from the transmitted lengths of its three sides using the formula of Heron:

$$
S = \sqrt(p(p-a)(p-b)(p-c))
$$

$p = \frac{a+b+c}{2}$

Integers are input to the program, the output of the program must be a real number corresponding to the area of the triangle.

#### Sample Input:

3

4

5

#### Sample Output:

6.0
