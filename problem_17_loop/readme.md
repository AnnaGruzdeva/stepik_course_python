Write a program that reads two numbers a and b from the keyboard, counts and prints to the console the arithmetic mean of all numbers from the segment [a; b], which are divided by 3.

In the example below, the arithmetic average is calculated for numbers on the interval [−5; 12]. Total numbers divisible by 3 on this segment are 6: −3.0,3,6,9,12. Their average is 4.5

At the entrance to the program, there are intervals, within which there is always at least one number, which is divisible by 3.

#### Sample Input:

-5

12

#### Sample Output:

4.5
