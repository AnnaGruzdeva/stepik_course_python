Kate learned that she needed X minutes to sleep. Unlike Nick, Kate goes to te bed after midnight at H hours and M minutes. Help Kate to determine the time for her to set the alarm so that it will ring exactly X minutes after she goes to bed.

On the standard input, each in its own line, the values X, H and M are given. It is guaranteed that Kate should wake up the same day that she falls asleep. The program should display the time for which the alarm should be set: the first line is the clock, the second is the minute.
